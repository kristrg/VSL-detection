# HandSpeak - VSL Recognition using MediaPipe
## Motivation
There are around 5% of world population, or about 450 million people, are Deaf/deaf people who require rehabilitation to address their 'disabling' hearing loss.

In Vietnam, the figure is around 2.5 million people. These are people who face lots of prejudices from the society and difficulties in accessing public services (education, healthcare, etc.) & job opportunities while there is little support from the 'normal' communities.

Therefore, HandSpeak is built to become a connection between the Vietnamese Deaf/deaf community and others by helping translate Vietnamese Sign Language to Vietnamese (word-level).
